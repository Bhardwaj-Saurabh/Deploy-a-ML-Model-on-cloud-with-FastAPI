```

## Running Instruction

- To Train Model
```
python src/train_model.py
```

```
pytest src/test_pipeline.py
```

- To Run the Web App Locally
```
uvicorn main:app
```

## Web App deployed on Render
Deployed App can be access [here](https://census-prediction-deploye.onrender.com/docs)


## Data
- Download census.csv from the data folder in the starter repository.
- Information on the dataset can be found here.
- This data is messy, try to open it in pandas and see what you get.
- To clean it, use your favorite text editor to remove all spaces.

## Model
- Using the starter code, write a machine learning model that trains on the clean data and saves the model. Complete any function that has been started.
- Write unit tests for at least 3 functions in the model code.
- Write a function that outputs the performance of the model on slices of the data.
- Suggestion: for simplicity, the function can just output the performance on slices of just the categorical features.
- Write a model card using the provided template.

## API Deployment to a Render Cloud Platform
- Create a Free Cloud Application Platform account, such as Render.
